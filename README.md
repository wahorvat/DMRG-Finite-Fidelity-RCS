# DMRG-Finite-Fidelity-RCS

This is an [iTensor](https://itensor.org/) implementation of the tensor network methods descibed in ['Density-Matrix Renormalization Group Algorithm for Simulating Quantum Circuits with a Finite Fidelity'](https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/pdf/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.020304). 

The focus is to develop the code with an eye toward running the paper's benchmarks, and potentially larger random circuit samplings, locally.
